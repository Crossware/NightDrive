NightDrive is a small game made for the [Unity x Lego gamejam](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/join-the-unity-x-lego-r-game-jam-ideas-edition?publish=true#) back in 2021.
The game was developed using the microgame assets as well as [BrickLink](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/main.page) to build the lego cars and assets, over the span of a couple of days working with a friend who did the designs, audio and icon.
